# Mountains

## How to build
You can build the APK in Android studio, however there are still bugs on some phones. Feel free to leave an issue of a bug you find!

Minimum SDK version: 21

## How to use
Point your phone towards the peak of a mountain you see. The app displays the name of this mountain and the distance to the mountain. This is a fun tool for if you are curious about geography and are travelling or away from home. It works best in mountainous regions, such as Vancouver, BC.

The dataset currently supports users in the lower mainland of British Columbia, but eventually will support all of Canada.
