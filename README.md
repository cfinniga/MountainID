# :mount_fuji: MountainID

This Android app is designed to help users identify mountains they see.

## How to build
You can download the app-debug.apk onto your phone to run it. You can also build it from the source code in Android Studio.

Minimum SDK version: 21

## How to use
Hold your phone out horizontally (screen facing the sky), with the top of your phone in the direction of the peak of a mountain you want to identify, and press the button. The app displays the name of this mountain, the distance to the mountain. This is a fun tool for those who are curious about geography, and are away from home. It works best in mountainous regions, such as Vancouver, BC.

The dataset currently supports users in the lower mainland of British Columbia, but eventually I'd like it to support all of Canada.

Feel free to report any bugs you find.
