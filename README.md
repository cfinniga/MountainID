# :mount_fuji: MountainID

This app is designed to help users identify mountains they see.

## How to build
You can build the APK in Android studio, however there are still bugs on some phones. Feel free to leave an issue of a bug you find!

Minimum SDK version: 21

## How to use
Point the top of your phone towards the peak of a mountain you want to identify. The app displays the name of this mountain and the distance to the mountain. This is a fun tool for those who are curious about geography, and are away from home. It works best in mountainous regions, such as Vancouver, BC.

The dataset currently supports users in the lower mainland of British Columbia, but eventually will support all of Canada.
