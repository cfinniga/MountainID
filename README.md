# Mountains
The user points their phone towards a mountain they see, the app displays the name of this mountain and the distance to the mountain. This is useful for people who are curious about geography and are travelling or away from their home.

There is currently no apk released, but you can download the source code and open the app in android studio, to run it.

The dataset currently supports users in the lower mainland of British Columbia, but eventually will support all of Canada.
